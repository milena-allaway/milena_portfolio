                        <div><p class="text"> My name is Milena Wheatcroft. I am a web developing student at UofT coding bootcamp. I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, camping, fishing,
                        and kayaking. I am most in my element when I'm near a body of water or surrounded by the tranquility of a forest. I love to travel and learn about
                        the history and architecture of new foreign places, and sample the local cuisine. I am originally from Lviv, Ukraine. My mother and I
                        immigrated to Canada when I was five years old and are happy to call it our home. I currently live in Mississauga, Ontario, with my
                        partner of 17 years, James, our son Logan, and our two cats, Dexter and Marley.<br>
                        After 16 years of working in the beauty industry as a hair colour specialist, I recently decided to make a career change.
                        The lively and chaotic atmosphere of a busy salon that I used to thrive in, had changed post pandemic.
                        In 2022, I became a mom and quickly realized that I wanted a better balance between my work and personal life.
                        I have always been fascinated with tech, so after a quick google search for jobs and education requirements, the cards
                        just fell into place. I looking forward to learning about this new field and am excited about the opportunies it will bring.</p>
