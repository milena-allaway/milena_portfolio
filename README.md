# Milena Wheatcroft's Portfolio

## Description:
This is my online portfolio. It's only just the beginning, and will evolve along with my coding skills.  As an aspiring web developer, I want to have a place I can showcase my projects and skills to potential employers. This is the first project I have written from scratch, and even though it's not at it's full potential yet, I am satisfied with the results and have learned valuable skills along the way. I learned how to make an image into a link that opens up in a new browser window, how to lay out content so it's responsive to a changing viewport, and how to add hover effects to links. I used placeholder images for future content, and was surprised to find such a wide, and random, variety of available online resources for this. I had some difficulty adding my LinkedIn and Instagram contact information, for some reason my personal URLs wouldn't work, so I will have to continue to investigate to see if there are privacy settings that are possibly causing the issue.

## Usage
When you visit "insert url here" you will see an online portfolio that looks like this:

When you click on the links in the navigation bar, you will be directed to the corresponding content on the page. In the "projects" section you will see some of the web applications I have worked on, with clickable images that will open the web application in a new browser window. At the bottom there is information on how to contact me, with a clickable email link.

## Credits
